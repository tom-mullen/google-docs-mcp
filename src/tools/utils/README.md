# Utils

Higher-level utility tools that orchestrate multiple API operations to support common workflows. These tools aren't coupled to a single API call but instead combine parsing, content manipulation, and batch updates.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `replaceDocumentWithMarkdown` | Replaces entire document content with Markdown-formatted content (headings, bold, italic, links, lists) |
| `appendMarkdownToGoogleDoc` | Appends Markdown content to the end of a document with full formatting |
